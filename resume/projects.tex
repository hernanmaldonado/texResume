\resumeItem{A fast and succinct name generator that can suggest previously unknown names based on a list of names currently used }
\resumeItem{The model was created by creating a directed graphs that has as edges the probability of transitioning between any pair of letters at each position of a name. Then by using those probabilities the model samples letters at each position using a multinominal distribution.}
\resumeItem{The project is showcased as CLI interactive mode both running the entire pipeline and using pickle to persist the graph used for faster results.}
\resumeItem{The project is also showcased as a local fast API deployment and under a dockerized deployment of the fast API version to show case potential alternatives for deploying the model in a production environment}
