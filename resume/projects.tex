\resumeProjectHeading{\textbf{NameGen: Name generator using Generative AI}}{\href{https://github.com/hernanmaldonado/nameGen}{\underline{Source Code}}}
\resumeItemListStart
\resumeItem{A fast and succinct name generator that can suggest previously unknown names based on a list of names currently used }
\resumeItem{The model was created by creating a directed graphs that has as edges the probability of transitioning between any pair of letters at each position of a name. Then by using those probabilities the model samples letters at each position using a multinominal distribution.}
\resumeItem{The project is showcased as CLI interactive mode both running the entire pipeline and using pickle to persist the graph used for faster results.}
\resumeItem{The project is also showcased as a local fast API deployment and under a dockerized deployment of the fast API version to show case potential alternatives for deploying the model in a production environment}

\resumeProjectHeading{\textbf{E-Commerce Fraud Detection}}{\href{https://github.com/hernanmaldonado/ML_Fraud_Detection/tree/main/ML_E-Commerce}{\underline{Source Code}}}
\resumeItemListStart
\resumeItem{Three tree based machine learning models tuned to detect fraud on an E-Commerce dataset.}
\resumeItem{This project showcases data analysis, feature engineering and model tuning for Random Forest, Isolation Forest and XGBoost applied to fraud detection.}
\resumeItem{For XGBoost the hyperparameter tuning is done using Optuna. }
\resumeItem{Finally, pipelines along joblib are used to save the models for deployment.}
